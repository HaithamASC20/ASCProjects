    <h1 class= "headers">About</h1>
    <p class = "text">I am a 16 year old junior in high school. I live in New Jersey, but I am from Palestine. In my free time I enjoy playing soccer and videogames. I also love programming. I wouldn't be myself without my parents, so I think they deserve to be part of this about section more than I do. My parents were born as Palestinian refugees and lived in the refugee camp for many years. They struggled their entire lives until they came to America and created a better life for themselves and their children. They ended up having four children (me being the youngest) and have worked incredibly hard to get us to where we are today. </p>
